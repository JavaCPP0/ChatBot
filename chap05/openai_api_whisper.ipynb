      "Translation(text=\"Hello, this is a lecture on how to make a chatbot with GPT API. Some of you may be unfamiliar with GPT API. We're going to talk about how to make the program we want using the chat GPT function that we know well. So there are a lot of lectures like this. There are many things, but if I were to say the characteristics of this lecture, it's not easy to make a chatbot program that achieves a clear mission with GPT. I'm going to talk about how to implement this and why it's necessary. As an example, there can be many examples. The example here is to create a program that automatically creates a music playlist video through conversation. So let me show you how the program runs. The program we're going to make is going to look like this.\")\n"
